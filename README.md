# Variable Frequency Generator

89C51 based variable frequency generator, with frequency range from 1 Hz to 20 KHz and duty cycle range from 0 to 100%

This project was developed in early 2012 as part of experiments that I was doing while I was learning microcontroller programming. The input values are fed using a 4x4 keypad. The output is collected at P3.0. This frequency generator is a cheap alternative to the other expensive frequency generators in laboratories and can be used in the development of several other projects. To simulate the project please upload the hex file in the microcontroller in Proteus.

The demonstration of this project can be seen in the youtube video which can be accessed through the following link:
